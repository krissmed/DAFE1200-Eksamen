                The final page is a community driven tips site, where users and manufacturers easily can integrate one product with the rest of your smart home for different things, room, or power consumption sources based on your energy-history. This page also shows you how much power you can save by doing the different tips. This can be integrated with different products and services like google home, or amazon alexa to make it easier to control. Here people can create and publish solutions like “goodnight google/alexa” will turn off the lights in rooms which are not in use during the night. You can also integrate it with other smart products like robotvacum, smart fridge, smart tv, etc. for the community to make different solutions to everyday problems. Another simple integration would be to turn off the lights when you can see that you’re not home by using phone location.
